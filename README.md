# Cinema Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software

Tool for managing scheduling and tickets at a movie theater.

Student exercise. Model for this program is the ERP for AMC Theatres as I can 
glean it from the AMC Theatres website.

Just in case it needs to be said, I don't own any of the AMC Theatres 
trademarks, nor do I have copyright in any of the movies mentioned.
