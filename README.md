# Cinema Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software

Tool for managing scheduling and tickets at a movie theater.

Student exercise. Model for this program is the ERP for AMC Theatres as I can 
glean it from the AMC Theatres website.

Just in case it needs to be said, I don't own any of the AMC Theatres 
trademarks, nor do I have copyright in any of the movies mentioned.

I was going to call this project "Detroit Cinema" but there's an actual Cinema 
Detroit. Dearborn is a suburb of Detroit that has quite a few movie theaters, 
but as far as I can tell none of them are called Dearborn Cinema nor Cinema 
Dearborn.
